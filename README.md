## What You Need to Do:

1. Clone the provided Starter Code Repository to your local development environment (e.g., VSCode): https://github.com/CodeSpace-Academy/Module_8_StudentNo_Classcode_Group_Name-Surname_JSL08
2. Open the cloned project in your code editor.
3. Code your solution for each of the challenges as per the provided instructions.
4. Commit your changes to your local Git repository with meaningful commit messages.
5. Push your local Git repository to your GitHub account.

## Breakdown:

1. Declared a variable to store the singleton instance
2. Defined a class called BankBranch for managing branch information
3. Created a constructor that takes branchInfo as a parameter
4.Used an if statement to create a new instance with the provided branchInfo and assign it to bankBranchInstance if it is null. 
4. returned the bankBranchInstance whether it's newly created or existing 
5. Added methods to the bankBrancH class for managing branch-related information 
6. Created instances BranchA and Branch with different information
7. Used the getBranchInfo method to retrieve information from the instances 
8. Verified that Branch A and Branch B are both referring to the same instance by comparing the using '==='
9. Used the updatebranch method to update BranchA information
10. Used the deleteBranch method to delete BranchB info
11. Verified that Branch A and Branch B are both still referring to the same instance. 

## Challenges:

1. N/A
